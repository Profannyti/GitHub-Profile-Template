# GitHub Profile Template

This GitHub profile template is inspired by the layout and design used by [Profannyti](https://github.com/Profannyti) in their README. It offers a clean and organized structure for showcasing your skills, projects, or personal information on your GitHub profile.

## How to Use

1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking this repository to your own GitHub account. You can do this by clicking the "Fork" button in the upper right corner of this page.

2. **Clone the Repository**: Once forked, clone the repository to your local machine using Git. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepository.git
    ```

    Replace `YourUsername` with your GitHub username and `YourRepository` with the name of your forked repository.

3. **Customize the Template**:
    - Replace placeholders such as "Your Name / Project Name" and "Brief introduction or tagline" with your own information in the HTML code provided in `README.md`.
    - Replace the placeholder URLs for logos with the URLs of the respective logos you want to display. You can use services like [SVG Repo](https://www.svgrepo.com/) or [Devicons](https://devicon.dev/) to find logos for various languages, frameworks, and technologies.
    - You can add or remove sections as needed to suit your preferences.

4. **Commit and Push Changes**: After customizing the template, commit your changes and push them to your GitHub repository.

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Updated README with my information"
    git push origin main
    ```

5. **Update GitHub Profile**: Finally, navigate to your GitHub profile settings, and under the "Repository visibility" section, select the repository you just forked as the repository you'd like to feature on your profile.
