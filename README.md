# GitHub Profile Template

This GitHub profile template is inspired by the layout and design used by [Profannyti](https://github.com/Profannyti) in their README. It offers a clean and organized structure for showcasing your skills, projects, or personal information on your GitHub profile.

# How to Use

## Creating Your GitHub Profile with a Special README

GitHub recently introduced a feature that allows users to customize their profile by adding a special README file to their account repositories. This feature enables you to showcase your projects, skills, and more directly on your GitHub profile, making it more personalized and informative for visitors.


## STEPS:
- Create a repository named after your GitHub username to unlock a special feature. (Don't forget to select the "Add a README file" option)
- Copy the code of the `Template-Code.html` file of this repository.
- Paste it in the `README.md` of your repository, preview it to see how it looks.
- Replace the links and content as per your liking.
- Star this repository to let me know that you found it useful ;)
